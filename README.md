# My Portfolio Website

This is the repository for my portfolio website.
---

I've used **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Javascript** to design this site. This project was useful to learn how to design and format a site using basic language syntax.

I've incorporated the **Animate.CSS** library to add some flavor to a few elements on screen. I've also used the **Ion-Icons** library for the *social icons* and *scroll-to-top* element.
