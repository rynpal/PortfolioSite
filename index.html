        <p class="bio-text">
          Hello, my name is Ryan Palumbo! I am currently a Senior Accountant in manufacturing looking to improve my skills as a developer and
          (hopefully) turn it into a new career; where I can build out software solutions, solve problems, and contibute to a dynamic team. 
          I've recently been creating tools in <b>Excel</b> and <b>JavaScript</b>for my
          colleagues. There is great satisfaction in observing others implement a
          tool you've designed to make their lives easier.

      <h2>More About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I have been thankful for the resources at
        <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org" target="_blank"
          >freeCodeCamp.org</a
        > and content found on their YouTube channel. The path that they have designed to introduce people to coding is the most
        welcoming and encouraging that I have found. I am also incredibly thankful for the mentors 
        that have encouraged me to pursue a new career. I wouldn't have been able to maintain progress without 
        them. That encouragment has led me to work with and learn these technologies:<br>
        <b>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, SQL, .NET Core, VS Code, and more!</b><br>
        I've been able to grow past the basic tools that one learns in the beginning of their coding journey. Comfortable with the logic 
        of programming, I see that most programming languages operate under the same principles and rules. The skill of learning is 
        something that I wish I had the taste for when I was in school. Now, I'm ready to really learn and put this knowledge in to practice 
        in an engineering role!
      </p>
      <p>
        My expertise in <b>Excel</b> has been a great resource for
        learning programming. Even before I knew what a relational database was, I was creating them in <b>Excel</b>.
        Having grown in my knowlege of <b>SQL queries</b>, I have a greater appreciation for the 
        technologies available to the industry. With the help of built in functionality (ie. libraries),
        I have been creating small applications to help my colleagues in their day-to-day.
      </p>
      <p>
        While technology is interesting to me, I do have other interests and hobbies. I am an avid
        outdoorsman and family man. I love to spend as much time as possible with my
        family. We enjoy fishing, reading, sports of all kind, Legos, art projects, movie nights, and more.
        I appreciate every moment that we spend together. I also volunteer
        as the archery coach for the school where my wife teaches. My family is also involved in our local church 
        where my wife and I teach Sunday School to the youth.

            <b>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</b> to develop this site. I've used
            <b>JQuery</b> as well to add some efficiencies. This project was
            useful in understanding how to set up a functions time interval and
            clearing it on demand.

            Enjoy this Rock, Paper, Scissors game! Using
            <b>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</b>, I've set up an app where the user
            can select an option and play it against the computer. I was able to
            use the <b>local storage</b> in the browser to maintain a players
            record, even after the window is closed. I wanted to design
            something simple that my friends and family could enjoy, so I've
            added some feeling of animation to the gameplay.
